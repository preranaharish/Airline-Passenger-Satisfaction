# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction
Every business depends on customer satisfaction and the Airline industry runs on the same model. Customer satisfaction depends on various factors of the airlines such as satisfaction level in the food, drinks, online boarding, etc. Our approach to the business problem is to find out the factors which directly influence customer satisfaction. Main goal for the business is to minimize the influence/occurrences of negative factors that affect customer satisfaction.
# The brief approach for the solution is given below
1. Solution requires model building based on the Classification model approach to predict
whether the customer is satisfied with the airline services or not and to identify what
actually went wrong.
2. Data cleansing and Pre-Processing are important to have a good cleaned input dataset
for the model to predict the expected output. Hence the data cleansing and preprocessing steps are given in a detailed manner.
3. Visualization has been given to understand the dataset that feed into the model. This
also helps to understand the structure of dataset.
4. Model Creation: Creating Models for each of the ML classification Algorithms.
5. The benchmarking of outcome has been captured. The performance of the model is
tuned based on the different iterations with different parameters.
6. The business derived value based on the outcome of the model is analyzed.
7. Limitations of the model and scope of improvement has been covered.
8. The lessons learnt on each of the step of the project is noted down and summary is
provided as Learnings.
